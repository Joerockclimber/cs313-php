                <p align="justify">
                    I grew up in southern california. I'm the second oldest out of five in my family. When I was in my childhood scouts was a big part of my life. That led into rock climbing in high school. Rock climbing has really gotten me into the fittness mind set. I'm also a huge yoga enthusiast. I served my mission in Georgia Macon mission. After I graduate I hope to join a company like The Ocean Cleanup or The City of Hope and provide my skills for the beenifit of the cause.

                    I've been climbing for over 10 years. I started out climbing at a local gym. Soon after that I met my Coach, his name was Czar, and we made the first local youth climbing team with six other teammates. Over the years rock climbing has exploded and now our local youth team has over 30 climbers in it. It was in the youth team when I really started climbing hard and out doors. Now I'm so addicted I can't picture myslef ever stoping.

                <p align="justify">
                    I served my mission in Macon, Georgia. The mission covered everthing from Columbus, Macon, and Augusta, a bit of a diagonal line, all the way down to the Flordia Gorgia line. We also had a sliver of Alabama and the southren region of south Carolina. For U.S. missions it was a decent size. The areas I had where: Macon, Warner Robins, Forsyth, Ridgeland SC, Evans, and LaGrange. During my mission I fell in love with the people and the balmy southren air.
